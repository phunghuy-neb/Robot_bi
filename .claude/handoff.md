# Handoff - Robot Bi

> Current-state handoff only. Historical details belong in `changelog/`.

## Current State

- `PROJECT.md` is the source of truth for rules, protected fixes, workflow, and AI context policy.
- Current source root is `src/`; `src_brain/` is deprecated and must not be used.
- Main entry point: `src/main.py`.
- API server: `src/api/server.py`.
- Parent App: `frontend/parent_app/`.
- Robot Display: `frontend/robot_display/`.
- Firmware: `firmware/Robot_BI/Robot_BI.ino`.
- Runtime DB: `runtime/robot_bi.db`.
- Generated agent docs: `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`, regenerated with `python sync.py`.

## Last Completed Task

- 2026-05-13: **Parent App React + Vite migration — IMPLEMENTED (spec 001-parent-app-redesign, T001–T072)**. Full React + Vite SPA built under `frontend/parent_app/src/`. Legacy `index.html` replaced with Vite mount shell. `npm run build` passes (191KB JS, 20KB CSS). All Tier 1 backend APIs preserved in `src/services/api.js`. Tier 2 features use mock data with badges. 5-tab navigation, sidebar, settings overlay, admin section, and all 5 pages implemented. SYSTEM_MAP.md updated.

- 2026-05-13: **Parent App UI Redesign — spec artifacts updated for React + Vite target (spec 001-parent-app-redesign)**. All spec files updated. SYSTEM_MAP.md was reverted then correctly updated after implementation.

- 2026-05-13: AI context and instruction docs were normalized so PROJECT remains authoritative, SYSTEM_MAP is descriptive only, Spec Kit is conditional, and generated agent docs sync from PROJECT.

## Known Issues

- Wake-word custom `bi_oi` model is not confirmed; current repo contains dev/test wake-word paths.
- Cloudflare quick tunnel URL may change after restart unless a named tunnel is configured.
- YAMNet TFLite support depends on optional runtime dependencies.
- Camera, browser audio, mobile behavior, and motor hardware still require real-device verification.

## Next Recommended Action

- **Parent App React+Vite migration is complete**. Next steps: (1) Manual browser test — login with real credentials, verify WebSocket status, check each tab's API calls in Network tab. (2) If backend serves Parent App via `ops_router.py` StaticFiles, point it to `frontend/parent_app/dist/` instead of the root `frontend/parent_app/`. (3) When backend features for Tier 2 are ready, implement them by replacing mock adapters in `frontend/parent_app/src/services/api.js` (search for `// TODO: backend integration`).
- For other code changes, read `PROJECT.md`, this handoff, and relevant source files.
- For large feature/API/schema/cross-module work, use Spec Kit or write a clear plan first.
